                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h3>The F-22 Raptor is a twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the U.S. Air Force. Designed primarily for air superiority, it also has ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. Its advanced stealth, integrated avionics, and superior performance make it a formidable aerial combatant.</h3>
                <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stealthy as a Marble: The F-22's radar cross-section is reportedly the size of a marble, making it incredibly difficult for enemy radar systems to detect.</li>
                    <li>Super-cruise Champion: It can "super-cruise," meaning it can fly at supersonic speeds (greater than Mach 1.5) without using its fuel-guzzling afterburners. This greatly extends its range and operational envelope.</li>
                    <li>Thrust Vectoring Wizard: The F-22 has thrust-vectoring nozzles that can independently direct engine thrust up or down, giving it incredible agility and maneuverability that seems to defy physics.</li>
                    <li>No Exports Allowed: Due to its highly advanced and sensitive technology, the F-22 Raptor has never been authorized for export to any other country, making it exclusive to the U.S. Air Force.</li>
                    <li>Internal Weapons Bays: To maintain its stealth profile, the F-22 carries its weapons internally in bays that only open for a brief moment when missiles are launched. This keeps it "invisible" until the very last second.</li>
